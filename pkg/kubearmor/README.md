KubeArmor is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system that restricts the behavior (such as process execution, file access, and networking operations) of pods, containers, and nodes (VMs) at the system level.

KubeArmor leverages Linux security modules (LSMs) such as AppArmor, SELinux, or BPF-LSM to enforce the user-specified policies. KubeArmor generates rich alerts/telemetry events with container/pod/namespace identities by leveraging eBPF.
